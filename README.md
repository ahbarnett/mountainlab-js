# MountainLab (JavaScript implementation)

## Installation instructions

Note: If you have a prior version of MountainLab installed, then you should uninstall it (either via apt-get remove or by removing mountainlab/bin from your path)

### Installation outline:
1. Install prerequisites
2. Clone the repo and build via npm
3. Configure

### Prerequisites:
**nodejs** (recent version), **npm** (node package manager), **mongodb**
*NB. By default package managers on most unix systems will give you a very old version of nodejs, which is unlikely to work. Point them to a recent version by using the commands below.*

For example, on Ubuntu 16.04
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm mongodb
```

On Fedora/CentOS
```
curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash -
sudo yum install nodejs npm mongodb
```

### Clone the source repo and build

```
git clone https://github.com/flatironinstitute/mountainlab-js
cd mountainlab-js
npm install
```
Then, add "mountainlab-js/bin" to your PATH variable.
For example, you might add the following line at the end of your .bashrc file (and then open a new terminal)
```
export PATH=[your/path/to]/mountainlab-js/bin:$PATH
```

### Configuration
If the above PATH was set up properly then you should get configuration information by running
```
ml-config
```

MountainLab-js is configured by setting environment variables which ideally should be specified in the ~/.mountainlab/mountainlab.env file
The following are some of the configuration variables (they each have a default value if left empty):
* `ML_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY` -- the location where temporary data files are stored (default: /tmp/mountainlab-tmp)
* `ML_PACKAGE_SEARCH_DIRECTORY` -- the primary location for ML processing packages (default: ~/.mountainlab/packages)
* `ML_ADDITIONAL_PACKAGE_SEARCH_DIRECTORIES` -- optional additional directories to search for packages (colon separated list)
* `ML_ADDITIONAL_PRV_SEARCH_DIRECTORIES` -- optional additional directories to search for files pointed to by .prv objects

### Command reference

The following commands are available from any terminal. Use the `--help` flag on any of these commands to get more detailed information.
* `ml-config`  Show the current configuration (i.e., environment variables)
* `ml-exec-process`  Run a processor job without involving the process cache for completed processes
* `ml-lari-start`  Start a lari server, making your local machine a processing server
* `ml-list-processors`  List all registered processors on the local machine
* `ml-prv-create`  Create a new .prv file based on an existing data file (computes the sha1sum, etc)
* `ml-prv-locate`  Locate a file on the local machine based on a .prv file
* `ml-prv-sha1sum`  Compute the sha1sum of a data file (uses a cache for efficiency)
* `ml-prv-stat`  Compute the prv object for a data file (uses a cache for efficiency)
* `ml-queue-process`  Queue a processor job for running when resources become available
* `ml-run-process`  Run a processor job
* `ml-spec`  Retrieve the spec object for a particular registered processor

## Installing processor packages

By default, only a few system processors are registered. Those can be found in mountainlab-js/system-packages. To install additional processor packages, clone package repositories into the ~/.mountainlab/packages directory (or other configured directories). MountainLab-js will recursively search in these locations to find `.mp` files with executable permissions. Each such file corresponds to a processor package and responds to the `spec` argument with JSON text output defining the list of processors associated with the package.
